# rule *em* all

Nobody likes media queries in pixels. You wont press your well crafted content in an inflexible corset of absolute units. Thatâ€™s why you will tend to use *em*. But why calculate the numbers by yourself?

## Usage

Include the *em* meter JavaScript file while your development or use the [bookmarklet](http://ruleemall.laube.rocks/). You will see a box at the bottom left corner of your viewport which shows you the current width and height in *em*.

The *em* ruler is more a fun tool but maybe useful for you. It will show a ruler with a stepping of 5 at the top of the viewport.
